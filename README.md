# Gradebook App

A simple, lightweight gradebook application built with vanilla JavaScript.  
The app allows adding, validating, displaying, deleting, and persisting student grade entries.

This project was created as a **learning-focused front-end exercise**, with an emphasis on clean JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and Git workflow.
